What: We're building a [CLC Rhode Runner](https://clcboats.com/shop/boats/powerboats/clc-runabout-project.html) and sharing our process along the way.

Why: After deciding on the goal of building a boat, we were surprised by the lack of consolidated information on the complete process including the practial parts. A consolidated source for information on the woodworking, epoxy work, equipment, electronics, motor was missing. A secondary objective is to share the process with friends and family.

Who: Two folks in Switzerland
