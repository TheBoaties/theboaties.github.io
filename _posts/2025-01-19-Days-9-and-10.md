# Days 9 and 10

This weekend was one of the first times we felt we were actually working on the boat.

## Log
- Prepared first layer of epoxy on the fiberglass 
- Allowed epoxy to set, around 2 hrs
- Applied second layer of epoxy

## Learnings
- Epoxy wets the fiberglass much better when it is warm. Too cold and the viscosity doesn't allow it to run into the weave.
- Applying epoxy before the wood and room is completely warm can result in outgassing and small bubbles between the epoxy and wood that need to be sanded out.
- Using too much force to remove excess epoxy from the fiberglass pulls the fiberglass too tight, increasing the risk of creating bubbles if the surface is not completely flat.
