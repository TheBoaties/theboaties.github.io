# Day 4

## Log
- The tests from the previous day were successful.
- Test using tarp to make a tent. The radiator was inside the tent, parts inside the tent. 25 degrees was reached.
- Port planks 1 through 4 and one of the bottom pieces were assembled and left to cure overnight.

## Learnings
- Use tarp to contain heat and conserve energy
- Clamps are more difficult to use than weigth to hold puzzle joints together.
