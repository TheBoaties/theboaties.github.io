# Days 5 and 6
It is starting to come together. We're completed most of the puzzle joints. There is always a lot of love and harmony in the room despite the lack of warmth. We heat it up with passion.

# Log
- Assembled deck accent strips and sanded flat.
- Assembled most frame doublers (epoxy only)
- Completed epoxying of most puzzle joints. Only the longitudinal stringers remain.
- Sanded all puzzle joints that had been created more than 24h before. Remaining is the cockpit sides and deck.

# Learnings
- Epoxy needs 48h to cure, 24h is not sufficient when it is cold.
- Sanding with the orbital sander is extremely effective, just be careful not to sand through the veneer.
- The block plane needs to be set properly to work well, if not it can do more harm than good.
