# Days 5 and 6

# Log
- Completed epoxying of most puzzle joints. Only the longitudinal stringers remain.
- Sanded all puzzle joints that had been created more than 24h before. Remaining is the cockpit sides and deck.

# Learnings
- Epoxy needs 48h to cure, 24h is not sufficient when it is cold.
- Sanding with the orbital sander is extremely effective, just be careful not to sand through the veneer.
