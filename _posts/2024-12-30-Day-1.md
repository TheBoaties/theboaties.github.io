# Day 1
Today was exciting. There was some confusion with DHL on when the wood pallet would be delivered. In the end, we arrived at the same time as the driver. Even knowing the size, it was still surprising how large the wood is. 
## Log of the day
- Unpack pallet and move into the room
- Sort hardwood
- Sort plywood sheets
- Singulate all sheets

## Learnings
- The second heater is still insufficient. After being on most of the day, the room almost made it to 13 degrees. Outside was below zero, so once we are epoxying and fiberglassing the heat will not be sufficient for proper curing.
- The room is small. We'll need to organize carefully to keep organized.
- Take the time to cut tabs to singulate all pieces as close to the part as possible, this simplifies the cleanup process afterwards.
