# Days 2 and 3
With the single pieces out of the plywood sheets, they all needed to be cleaned up: imperfections in the cutting process, imprefections in the wood, residues from the tabs connecting each piece to the larger sheets.

## Achievements
- Successful tests for curing epoxy

## Learnings
- Take your time at the start to cut out the individual pieces the first time, otherwise the work will need to be duplicated
- It is necessary to mix epoxy by weight when it is cold
- It is futile to try to heat a garage to 15 degrees when it is zero outside. Attempt for the next day: hot box with tarp
