# Days 7 and 8
We realized that the tent we were building would not allow us to cure epoxy over anything larger than small single parts. So, we decided to build a tent to locally heat without massive heating bills. The room we are renting is not heated, so we bought radiator to heat the space. At 2kW, it costs roughly 500 chf per month if running full time. We have ordered a power meter to track it, which we will install next week after it arrives.

Still to assemble is the variable height ceiling, which will further let us reduce the energy needd to keep the room hot once we are working on the complete tent.

Coming up next, we being fiberglass on the bottom and deck, after which we can begin the stich-and-glue process.

## Log
- Having designed the tent at home, we began assembly. The sides, and ceiling are complete.
- Assembly of three floorboard cleats
- Assembly of frame 5 doubler, the final doubler
